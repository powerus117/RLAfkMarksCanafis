This plugin allows the player to track the mark of grace cooldown on the canafis agility course.

This is how you can use it:
1. Run the canafis course until u find a mark of grace (this is 66% per run) and the overlay will appear
2. Wait on the last roof of the course (the overlay will say wait)
3. AFK until the timer runs out and you get a notify
4. Run the course (the overlay will say run) 
5. Repeat
