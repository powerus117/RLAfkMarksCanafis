## Marks of Grace Cooldown
This plugin allows the player to track the marks of grace cooldown on any Agility Course. It makes use of the marks of grace spawning mechanic as mentioned in the OSRS Wiki:

    Each course has a chance to spawn a mark of grace upon completion given that enough time has passed since the last mark of grace was spawned. For most courses this is three minutes. [...]

    This timer works on the scale of minutes, so if a mark of grace spawned at 00:00 game time, you would have another chance starting from the first tick of game time 00:03, regardless of what tick the mark spawned at during 00:00. This timer persists even after logging out or changing worlds.

    Upon completing a lap after the timer has expired, the chance to have a mark of grace spawn is [...] 2/3 for the Canifis and Ardougne Rooftop Course, [...].

This allows us to maximize the marks of grace spawning by timing the moment we finish a full lap with the cooldown shown.
 
## How to use
1. Run an Agility Course that spawns marks of grace until you find one and the overlay will appear.
2. When the overlay says wait, wait on the last rooftop of the course until the timer runs out.
3. When the timer runs out, you will get a notification. You can now finish the course, there is a chance this generates a new mark of grace (2/3 on Canifis)
4. Run the course (the overlay will say run).
5. Repeat!

The plugin was originally made to AFK on the last obstacle, but as an alternative to step 2, you could do anything else, continue running for xp (without marks spawning), do another activity etc. 
As long as you try to time your lap finishes with the cooldown, you should be getting the maximum number of marks spawning.
