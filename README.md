## AFK Marks Canifis
This plugin allows the player to track the marks of grace cooldown on the Canifis Rooftop Agility Course. It makes use of the marks of grace spawning mechanic as mentioned in the OSRS Wiki:

    Each course has a chance to spawn a mark of grace upon completion given that enough time has passed since the last mark of grace was spawned. For most courses this is three minutes. [...]

    This timer works on the scale of minutes, so if a mark of grace spawned at 00:00 game time, you would have another chance starting from the first tick of game time 00:03, regardless of what tick the mark spawned at during 00:00. This timer persists even after logging out or changing worlds.

    Upon completing a lap after the timer has expired, the chance to have a mark of grace spawn is [...] 2/3 for the Canifis and Ardougne Rooftop Course, [...].

This allows us to maximize the marks of grace spawning while minimizing our effort to get them by waiting on the last rooftop, just before jumping down to get your big Agility XP drop.
 
## How to use
1. Run the Canifis Rooftop Agility Course until you find a mark of grace and the overlay will appear.
2. When the overlay says wait, wait on the last rooftop of the course until the timer runs out.
3. When the timer runs out, you will get a notification. You can now jump down from the course, this will generate a new mark of grace with a 2/3 chance.
4. Run the course (the overlay will say run).
5. Repeat!

**Note:** this uses the local PC's time. If your time is incorrect for some reason on a seconds level, this could make the plugin less reliable.
